# Changelog

## [0.11.0] - work in progress

### Added

- `Hyperedge.transform()`: pattern-based rewrites.
- per-atom `tok_pos`/`text_span` and per-root `Hyperedge.tokens` source-position metadata.
- continuity-aware sub-edge text derivation with verbatim character-offset slicing.
- `transforms.tok_pos_tree(edge)` rebuilds the parallel `tok_pos` tree from in-memory atoms.
- readers provide source information.
- `hyperbase.parsers.badness` module for parser-agnostic combined structural + token-matching validation.
- built-in REPL setting `check_badness` to render a badness panel after each parse, available regardless of the active parser plugin.
- more REPL commands: /load, /unload, /save, /save-parse, /search, /count, /count-csv, /types, /transform, /classify and /unload-parser.

### Changed

- subtypes can have any length, pattern matching treats such cases correctly.
- transforms propagate per-atom `tok_pos`/`text_span` through rewrites.
- REPL `/load` now uses `ParseResult.from_dict` (was dropping `tokens`/`tok_pos`).
- REPL shows multiple results if available.

### Fixed

- pattern matcher no longer returns partial bindings on structural mismatch in `{...}` argrole patterns.

### Removed

## [0.10.0] - 11-04-2026

### Added

- `[]` pattern notation for specifying sequences of arguments.
- EdgeType and ArgRole enums.
- safety cap for match (`_MAX_ARGROLE_ITEMS=10`) against pathological edge arities.
- caching of computed `Hyperedge`/`Atom` properties.
- `parse_to_jsonl` method on `Parser`.
- unified parameter interface for parsers.
- method `Parser.accepted_params`.
- maximum depth protection for parsers.
- repl api for parsers.

### Changed

- multiple patterns functions are now `Hyperedge`/`Atom` methods: `is_wildcard`, `is_pattern`, `is_fun_pattern`, `is_variable`, `contains_variable`, `variable_name`.
- `hyperbase.py` now delegating to smaller modules with well-defined concerns: `builders.py`, `correctness.py`, `transforms.py`, `patterns.checks.py` and `patterns.matcher.py`.
- replaced `itertools.permutations` with constraint-propagated backtracking in argrole matcher.
- `parse_text` renamed to `parse`; old iterator-based `parse` removed.
- `read_source` renamed to `parse_source`; `read_source_to_jsonl` renamed to `parse_source_to_jsonl`.
- renamed `sentensize` to `get_sentences`.
- hedge now uses an explicit stack instead of recursion (so that pathologically
    nested edge strings cannot exhaust Python's call stack).
- renamed parsers.correctness to parsers.badness.

### Removed

- `__add__` operator overloading in `Hyperedge`/`Atom`.
