"""Parser-agnostic parse-correctness checking for parsed edges.

Where :func:`hyperbase.correctness.check_correctness` validates a hyperedge in
isolation, this module checks a whole *parse*: the edge plus how its atoms map
onto the original tokens. :func:`check_parse_correctness` combines the hard
grammar errors, the soft structural-quality errors, and token-matching
validation so any parser plugin can score the output of a parse against the
original tokens. The third value in each error tuple is a severity (lower is
worse): ``0`` for hard correctness failures -- which includes the vocabulary
failures of :func:`check_vocabulary` -- ``1`` for token-mismatch issues -- which
includes the alignment failures of :func:`check_alignment` -- ``2`` for argrole
problems, ``3`` for junction issues.

Token matching alone is a *multiset* check: it asks whether the parse's atom
roots and the sentence's tokens account for each other, not which atom sits on
which token. When the caller also has the ``tok_pos`` tree -- the parallel tree
naming, per atom, the token it was aligned to -- passing it turns on
:func:`check_alignment`, which checks that correspondence position by position.
The two are not redundant: a sentence whose text spells out a connector
character (``19:18``) balances perfectly as a multiset while the alignment has
the no-token ``:/J/.`` sitting on the colon and the real ``:/Bx.ma`` on nothing.

When ``strict`` is ``True``, the underlying :func:`check_correctness` also
enforces that every predicate specification-role (``x``) argument is a
specifier (``S``), emitting a ``spec-arg-not-specifier`` failure otherwise.
Default (``strict=False``) behaviour is unchanged.

:func:`parse_coverage` exposes the same token↔atom matching as structured
data — which original tokens went unused and which atoms no token accounts for —
so callers (e.g. a correctness-guided search) can attribute coverage failures
to specific tokens instead of only reading the error messages.

Matching is by exact, case-insensitive surface identity: an atom's root must
*be* one of the tokens. It used to be fuzzy — punctuation stripped from both
sides, then a cascade of concatenation fallbacks so a parse built on one
tokenizer could be scored against another's tokens (spaCy's ``U.S.`` against
``u`` + ``s``, an atom pair ``1`` + ``m`` against the token ``1m``). Every
parser in the ecosystem now shares one tokenizer, and that tolerance quietly
accepted parses no per-token model can represent: ``c'`` cleaned to ``c`` and
matched the token ``c``, so nothing flagged an atom that no token can carry.
